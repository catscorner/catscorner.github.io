# catscorner.github.io
Welcome to cats corners home on the internet. This simpel format page is enough for our needs and speed is enough. And its free. Which works perfectly for an open organisation of dancers. 

### Why github 
its free, it contains github pages where we currently resides 

### Why not wordpress
Wordpress is a big good tool. And alot of overhead. We are a small community. We make small changes. and using bootstrap is enough for our styling requirements. This also gives up community access so that we as a group can work on the homepage. And or come with suggestions and improvements.
